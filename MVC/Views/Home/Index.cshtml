        <h2>Why DevWork</h2>
        <p>
            DevWork is completely free to use for developers and employers. We don't charge a fee like other
            services for you to post a job or to complete the work. We simply link the employer and developer together.

        your LinkedIn account to import your profile information to DevWork. Once you're registered, employers and
        recruiters can contact you.</p>
